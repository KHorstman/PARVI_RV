# PARVI_RV
This python script converts one-dimensional spectra into radial velocities from data collected by the Palomar Radial Velocity Instrument (PARVI). It assumes that the wavelength solution is already calibrated. In addition to the data files, it requires PHOENIX model spectra and ATRAN spectra.
